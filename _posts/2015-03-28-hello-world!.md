title: Hello World!

First of all thanks to everyone who spends a bit of his time reading this blog.

It is said that every programmer need to have a blog, well, this is mine. I think it is a good practice for several reasons: write what you learn is an excellent way to check if you really have learned it or if you have done it correctly, share your knowledge so you can get feedback or help others...

This idea has been a recurrent one from a while but I discarded it for several reasons. The most important one was the lack of blog builder tool in which I feel comfortable, i.e., easy and fast, with a nice code syntax plugin out of the box, clean, cheep (free) and mobile friendly. Popular tools as Blogger seems like not fits here. Then I found Github pages, Jekyll and Poole that comply all the requirements, google for it if you are interested, there are tons of information. [Hire is]({{ site.github.repo }}) a link to this project page if you want to take a look.

So, now I don't have excuse. What is this blog about? Well, not sure right now, it pretends to be the place where I put all my software experiments, maybe a few tutorials and a pinch of random thoughts. I am a Java developer so provably al the stuff will be related to the JDK environment.

Hope you enjoy.
